Me personally I dont like the new phone law. The phone law has its negatives nad postites. One of thje negatives is that what if you need to login to something. Or u may need to contact someone for school stuff. A positve is thta people can hopefully pay attetion. Also do there work and not be so distractcted.`
My idea is an app called "study buddy AI" that makes personalized study plans for students. It meets the challenge rules because it uses AI saftey to help education and realistic since similare apps already exist. The AI would find what students struggle with amd give them practice questopns to get better. This would help students stay organized, improve their grades, and feel more confident. It would also make learing faier by giving everyone the same helpful tool for their education.

Users are encouraged to explore, discover interesting things, and take tests to gauge their knowledge. Clicking on the planets to display statistics and animations was the most effective interactive feature, making learning more interesting and visually appealing. Further exploration was encouraged by the score and discovery tracker. This exercise can be seen as an enjoyable method to combine digital creativity with science education. Next time, I would enhance the design by include more sound effects, intricate planet animations, and a system of progress badges to incentivize participants. For an even more dynamic experience, I could include mini-games or challenges.

The problem is that SNAP funding has stopped, making it hard for millions of low-income families to buy food, which especially harms children and the elderly. Technology could help by creating a simple app to quickly show people the closest food banks and free meal programs in their area. For example, my tool, "HarvestLink," would use GPS mapping to show real-time food aid availability nearby. However, a major challenge exists because many people who need SNAP lack steady internet or a smartphone to use an app. To fix this, "HarvestLink" would also work through simple text messages (SMS) to give basic addresses, ensuring wider access.

Technology has changed the holidays by allowing remote families to connect instantly via video calls. I think this change makes the holidays better because it bridges long distances for loved ones. However, new smart gadgets often distract us from the family members who are physically present. Therefore, developers should be responsible for adding simple "Family Mode" or "Downtime" settings to their devices. This ensures that their technology supports connection without ruining in-person quality time
