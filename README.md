# WHSTechNotes
Me personally I dont like the new phone law. The phone law has its negatives nad postites. One of thje negatives is that what if you need to login to something. Or u may need to contact someone for school stuff. A positve is thta people can hopefully pay attetion. Also do there work and not be so distractcted.`
