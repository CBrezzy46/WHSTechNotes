Me personally I dont like the new phone law. The phone law has its negatives nad postites. One of thje negatives is that what if you need to login to something. Or u may need to contact someone for school stuff. A positve is thta people can hopefully pay attetion. Also do there work and not be so distractcted.`
My idea is an app called "study buddy AI" that makes personalized study plans for students. It meets the challenge rules because it uses AI saftey to help education and realistic since similare apps already exist. The AI would find what students struggle with amd give them practice questopns to get better. This would help students stay organized, improve their grades, and feel more confident. It would also make learing faier by giving everyone the same helpful tool for their education.

Users are encouraged to explore, discover interesting things, and take tests to gauge their knowledge. Clicking on the planets to display statistics and animations was the most effective interactive feature, making learning more interesting and visually appealing. Further exploration was encouraged by the score and discovery tracker. This exercise can be seen as an enjoyable method to combine digital creativity with science education. Next time, I would enhance the design by include more sound effects, intricate planet animations, and a system of progress badges to incentivize participants. For an even more dynamic experience, I could include mini-games or challenges.
