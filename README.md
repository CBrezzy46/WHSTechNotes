Me personally I dont like the new phone law. The phone law has its negatives nad postites. One of thje negatives is that what if you need to login to something. Or u may need to contact someone for school stuff. A positve is thta people can hopefully pay attetion. Also do there work and not be so distractcted.`
My idea is an app called "study buddy AI" that makes personalized study plans for students. It meets the challenge rules because it uses AI saftey to help education and realistic since similare apps already exist. The AI would find what students struggle with amd give them practice questopns to get better. This would help students stay organized, improve their grades, and feel more confident. It would also make learing faier by giving everyone the same helpful tool for their education.
